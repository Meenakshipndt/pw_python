    "*Predefined Keywords in Python*\n",
    "\n",
    "Predefined keywords in Python are reserved words that have specific meanings within the language. They cannot be used as variable names, function names, or other identifiers. These keywords are essential for defining the structure and behavior of Python programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Examples of Predefined Keywords and Their Uses:*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Control Flow:*\n",
    "   * *if, else, elif:* Used for conditional statements to execute different code blocks based on specific conditions.\n",
    "   * *for:* Used for iterating over sequences (like lists, tuples, or strings).\n",
    "   * *while:* Used for creating loops that execute as long as a given condition is true.\n",
    "   * *break:* Used to terminate a loop prematurely.\n",

    "   * *try, except, else, finally:* Used for exception handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example Program:*\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "def greet(name):\n",
    "    print(\"Hello, \" + name + \"!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    name = input(\"Enter your name: \")\n",
    "    greet(name)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, def, if, __name__, and main are predefined keywords. def defines the greet function, if checks the condition, __name__ refers to the current module's name, and main is a common convention for the main execution point of a Python program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding and using these keywords correctly is fundamental to writing effective and efficient Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Compare and contrast mutable and immutable objects in Python with examples.\n",
    "## Mutable vs. Immutable Objects in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, objects can be classified into two categories: mutable and immutable. The key difference lies in their ability to be modified after creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mutable Objects\n",
    "Mutable objects can be changed after they are created. This means that the value stored in the object can be altered. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Examples of mutable objects:*\n",
    "* *Lists:*\n",
    "  python\n",
    "  my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "  my_list.append(4)  # Modifying the list\n",
    "  print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "  \n",
    "* *Dictionaries:*\n",
    "  python\n",
    "  my_dict = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}\n",
    "  my_dict['age'] = 31  # Modifying the dictionary\n",
    "  print(my_dict)  # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 31}\n",
    "  \n",
    "* *Sets:*\n",
    "  python\n",
    "  my_set = {1, 2, 3}\n",
    "  my_set.add(4)  # Modifying the set\n",
    "  print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4}\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Immutable Objects\n",
    "Immutable objects cannot be changed once they are created. If you want to modify an immutable object, you need to create a new object with the desired changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Examples of immutable objects:*\n",
    "* *Numbers (int, float, complex):*\n",
    "  python\n",
    "  x = 5\n",
    "  x = 6  # Creating a new integer object\n",
    "  print(x)  # Output: 6\n",
    "  \n",
    "* *Strings:*\n",
    "  python\n",
    "  my_string = \"Hello\"\n",
    "  my_string = \"World\"  # Creating a new string object\n",
    "  print(my_string)  # Output: World\n",
    "  \n",
    "* *Tuples:*\n",
    "  python\n",
    "  my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "  # my_tuple[0] = 4  # This will raise an error\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "*Key Differences:*\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | Mutable Objects | Immutable Objects |\n",
    "|---|---|---|\n",
    "| Modifiability | Can be changed after creation | Cannot be changed after creation |\n",
    "| Memory Usage | May consume more memory due to modifications | Generally more memory-efficient |\n",
    "| Performance | Can be slower for frequent modifications | Often faster for frequent operations |\n",
    "| Use Cases | Lists, dictionaries, sets for dynamic data | Numbers, strings, tuples for static data |\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the distinction between mutable and immutable objects is crucial for writing efficient and correct Python code.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These operators are fundamental building blocks of Python programming and are used extensively in various applications. Understanding their usage and behavior is essential for writing effective and efficient Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Explain the concept of type casting in Python with examples.\n",
    "## Type Casting in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "*Type casting* is the process of converting one data type to another. It's often necessary when you need to perform operations that require specific data types or when you want to display data in a particular format.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Type Conversions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Integer to Float:*\n",
    "   python\n",
    "   x = 5  # Integer\n",
    "   y = float(x)  # Convert to float\n",
    "   print(y)  # Output: 5.0\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Float to Integer:*\n",
    "   python\n",
    "   x = 3.14  # Float\n",
    "   y = int(x)  # Convert to integer\n",
    "   print(y)  # Output: 3\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "3. *String to Integer or Float:*\n",
    "   python\n",
    "   x = \"10\"  # String\n",
    "   y = int(x)  # Convert to integer\n",
    "   z = float(x)  # Convert to float\n",
    "   print(y)  # Output: 10\n",
    "   print(z)  # Output: 10.0\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "4. *Integer or Float to String:*\n",
    "   python\n",
    "   x = 10  # Integer\n",
    "   y = 3.14  # Float\n",
    "   s1 = str(x)  # Convert to string\n",
    "   s2 = str(y)  # Convert to string\n",
    "   print(s1)  # Output: 10\n",
    "   print(s2)  # Output: 3.14\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",

    "   print(z)  # Output: True\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Notes:\n",
    "* *Data Loss:* When converting from a larger data type to a smaller one, data loss may occur. For example, converting a float to an integer will truncate the decimal part.\n",
    "* *Invalid Conversions:* Attempting to convert a value to an incompatible data type will raise a ValueError. For example, converting the string \"hello\" to an integer will raise an error.\n",
    "* *Built-in Functions:* Python provides built-in functions like int(), float(), str(), and bool() for type casting.\n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding type casting, you can effectively manipulate data in your Python programs and ensure that your code works as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. How do conditional statements work in Python? Illustrate with examples.\n",
    "## Conditional Statements in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional statements allow your Python program to make decisions and execute different code blocks based on specific conditions. They are essential for controlling the flow of your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The if Statement\n",
    "The simplest conditional statement is the if statement. It executes a block of code if a given condition is True.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example:*\n",
    "python\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "if x > 0:\n",
    "    print(\"x is positive\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The if-else Statement\n",
    "The if-else statement provides an alternative block of code to execute if the condition is False.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example:*\n",
    "python\n",
    "x = -5\n",
    "\n",
    "if x > 0:\n",
    "    print(\"x is positive\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"x is negative\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The if-elif-else Statement\n",
    "The if-elif-else statement allows you to check multiple conditions and execute different code blocks based on the first condition that is True.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example:*\n",
    "python\n",
    "x = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "if x > 0:\n",
    "    print(\"x is positive\")\n",
    "elif x < 0:\n",
    "    print(\"x is negative\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"x is zero\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nested Conditional Statements\n",
    "You can nest conditional statements within each other to create more complex decision-making logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example:*\n",
    "python\n",
    "age = 25\n",
    "nationality = \"Indian\"\n",
    "\n",
    "if age >= 18:\n",
    "    if nationality == \"Indian\":\n",
    "        print(\"You are eligible to vote in India\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"You may or may not be eligible to vote, depending on your country's laws\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"You are not eligible to vote\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Short-Hand if Statements\n",
    "For simple conditions, you can use the short-hand if statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "if x > 0: print(\"x is positive\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Remember:*\n",
    "* The condition in an if statement must evaluate to a Boolean value (True or False).\n",
    "* Indentation is crucial for defining the code blocks within conditional statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "By effectively using conditional statements, you can create more flexible and intelligent Python programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Describe the different types of loops in Python and their use cases with examples.\n",
    "## Loops in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops are control flow statements that allow you to repeatedly execute a block of code until a certain condition is met. Python has two main types of loops: for loops and while loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "### for Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "for loops are used to iterate over a sequence of values (like a list, tuple, or string). They are often used when you know in advance how many times you need to repeat a task.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example:*\n",
    "python\n",
    "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "for fruit in fruits:\n",
    "    print(fruit)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Use cases:*\n",
    "* Iterating over lists, tuples, or strings.\n",
    "* Generating sequences of numbers (using the range() function).\n",
    "* Processing items in a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### while Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "while loops execute a block of code as long as a specified condition remains True. They are useful when you don't know the exact number of iterations needed beforehand.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example:*\n",
    "python\n",
    "count = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "while count < 5:\n",
    "    print(\"Count:\", count)\n",
    "    count += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Use cases:*\n",
    "* Repeating a task until a specific condition is met.\n",
    "* Creating infinite loops (though it's generally not recommended).\n",
    "* Implementing algorithms that require repeated calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nested Loops\n",
    "You can nest loops within each other to create more complex control flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example:*\n",
    "python\n",
    "for i in range(3):\n",
    "    for j in range(2):\n",
    "        print(i, j)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### break and continue Statements\n",
    "* **break:** Terminates the loop immediately, even if the loop condition is still True.\n",
    "* **continue:** Skips the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next one.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example:*\n",
    "python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "for number in numbers:\n",
    "    if number == 3:\n",
    "        break\n",
    "    print(number)\n",
    "\n",
    "for number in numbers:\n",
    "    if number % 2 == 0:\n",
    "        continue\n",
    "    print(number)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding the different types of loops and how to use them effectively, you can create more efficient and flexible Python programs."
